   * allows a single active Application, and no GUI elements can be created without
   * first launching that application. We have to use this callback method since we
   * want to be able to show both the first-time-setup window and the debug console
   * (when --console was specified) without showing the Chunky Launcher window.
   * When the callback is called we can be sure that the callback is called on the
   * application thread and that the application has been started, which makes it
   * possible to open other windows. If the main Chunky Launcher window should be
   * displayed then the callback argument can be used by calling stage.show().
